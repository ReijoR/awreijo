This code will refresh the entire webpage, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
which will cause the browser to request the page from the server again and redraw
the page with the updated content. This means that
if the content of the webpage is updated by the server,
the user will see the updated content after the page is refreshed.
However, If the page is dynamic and content updates are done by JavaScript,
then a simple refresh of the page won't update the content. In such cases,
you might need to look for ways to interact with the page
and/or the JavaScript code to update the content.

Please note that this code will run infinitely and refresh the website every minute,
you may want to add a condition to stop the loop after certain time or based on some other criteria.
Also, you need to replace the path of the chrome driver with the path of the chrome driver
in your local machine.
